//! The codctl command server (story #37).
//!
//! Every running Cod listens on one private Unix socket, at the path `codctl::default_socket_path` names (`$COD_SOCKET`, else `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cod/codctl.sock`). The socket's folder is made owner-only when it is missing, and the server refuses a folder that is a link, belongs to someone else or is open to group or others. A live socket of another Cod at the path is left alone (the first Cod keeps it); a stale one is replaced.
//! The protocol is the one of the `codctl` library: one JSON request per line, one JSON reply per line, versioned.
//!
//! The socket is served on background threads. Every request is handed to the foreground through one channel, and each runs as its own foreground task, so a command that waits (a save prompt of `workspace close`) never holds up the others and the GPUI thread never waits for a client.
//! Workspace commands use the operations of story #24 (`MultiWorkspace::activate`, `cod_show_pending`, `Workspace::new_local`, `Workspace::open_paths`), so the window shows each change as the matching UI action does.
