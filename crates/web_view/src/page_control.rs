//! A thin bridge from `codctl_server`'s `codctl page` and `codctl open <url>` commands (#38)
//! to the page registry of #31 and #32.
//!
//! Page tabs exist on Linux and macOS, behind the off-screen browser backend (`pages`,
//! `#[cfg(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "macos"))]`, issue #23 round 1 widens this from
//! Linux-only). Every function here has the same signature on every platform, so `codctl_server`
//! never needs its own `#[cfg(...)]`: elsewhere (Windows, or any future target) it simply reports
//! that page tabs are not available, the same way a missing file or pane would.
