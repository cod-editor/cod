"""Story #28: agent chats belong to a workspace, with keyboard-reachable links.

The chats talk to the scripted fake agent in fake_acp_agent.py (ACP over stdio, the interface of Claude Code and Codex in Zed's agent panel), registered in the test settings as the custom agent `claude-acp`.
This file holds the representative path of AC5 and AC6 (links and file mentions in a reply, reached and opened from the keyboard); the workspace criteria follow with the status contract.
