"""Story #26: the workspace overview. One shortcut opens a floating picker with every workspace and its folders, sessions and pages, most urgent first; typing filters, the arrows move, Enter goes there, Escape goes back. One test per acceptance criterion or pair of criteria.

Fixtures are the throwaway git repo billing-api with invented content and three invented workspaces, made and named with the commands of #24 from the command palette in the order PAY-1234, DOC-208, OPS-77, so the window order differs from the order of urgency.
Session and page states come from the driver's set_entry test fixture (tests/e2e/cod_status_fixtures.py), which stands in for the scripted fake agent provider of #28 until it lands.
